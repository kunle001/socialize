## SOCIALIZE: Microservices-based social media application

Socialize is a simple backend structure for a social media website where you can signin , signup, create a post, share your posts to everyone
on the platform and people get to like and comment on your post. 
This even gets better from a software scalability , availability and efficiency view, as it is built with a microservice architecture, which makes it meet the requirements. 



### Microservices Architecture

As said earlier socialize employs a microservices architecture, enabling efficient communication and interaction among three distinct services:

1. **Authentication Service:** Manages user authentication, including login, signup, password management, and secure session handling using JWT. Sensitive data is protected, and cookies are securely managed.

2. **Likes and Comment Service:** Handles the creation, editing, and deletion of comments related to posts, also liking a post, facilitating user engagement and interaction.

3. **Post Service:** Responsible for all aspects of posts management, from creating a post to updating it, to deleting.


## Technologies and Tools

socialize utilizes a robust tech stack for its microservices architecture:

- Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
- Skaffold for streamlining the development workflow.
- POSTGRESQL for efficient and scalable database management.
- TypeScript for type-safe and maintainable code.
- Express as the backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- RABBITMQ Service for seamless communication between microservices.


## Backend Technologies

The backend of TicketX is built with Node.js and Express, providing a robust foundation for handling API requests and data processing.

## Cloud Services

socialize is to be hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services), ensuring high availability and scalability. Additionally, Namecheap services are utilized for domain management.

I am excited to soon launch socialize and provide a revolutionary social experience that integrates microservices architecture, cutting-edge technologies, and user-centered features. Stay tuned for more updates and our official launch!
